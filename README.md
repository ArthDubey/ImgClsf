# Decision Tree Based Classifier
High paced image classifier, low in accuracy
# Aim

This Project aims to build an image classifier that requires substiantially low computational power and is extremely high paced.
However the trade off being that it's accuracy is somewhere around 76-81%. This is suitable for general purpose uses in heavy
pipelines where computational power is the bottleneck.

## Getting Started

Clone the repository in your system and follow these steps-
1. Check if the requirements are satisfied.
2. Run the script imgclsf.py with argument as test1.jpg
3. This should give you the result for an already in-built example.

If you wish to train your data then follow these steps-
1. Make folders named classif1, classif2... classif5 for all your classifying sets. For example
if you wish to distinguish between roses , daisies and sunflowers then put images of roses in classif1, daisies in classif2 and so on.
2. Make sure that all images are resized to 127*127 for best results.
3. Take your test image and put it in the same folder as main script.
4. Now Run the main script (imgclsf.py) with test image filename as argument

### Prerequisites

1.SciPy 

2.Numpy 

3.Imageio 

4.Open-cv

Note- All of these can be easily installed via pip

```
pip install scipy
pip install numpy
```
